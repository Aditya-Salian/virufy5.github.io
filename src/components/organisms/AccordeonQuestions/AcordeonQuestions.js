              Our app is currently for data collection only. We cannot release a COVID-19 prediction app without public health department approvals in each country and clinical studies to validate the AI technology in local conditions. This process can take some weeks or months depending on the speed of the government partner. Virufy welcomes partnerships from health officials and hospitals to bring the technology for free use to the people and to optimize usage of costly PCR tests only when necessary.
