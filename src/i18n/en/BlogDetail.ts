        'In the big scheme of healthcare operations, predictive models play a role not unlike that of blood tests, X-rays, or MRIs: They influence decisions about whether an intervention is appropriate. ' +
        '“Broadly speaking, models do math and yield probability estimates that help you decide whether to act,” says Nigam Shah, Chief Data Scientist for Stanford Health Care and a Stanford HAI faculty member. ' +
        'But those probability estimates are only useful to healthcare providers if they trigger decisions that are more beneficial than not. ' +
        '“As a community, I think we’re hung up on the performance of the model and not asking the question, Is the model useful?” Shah says. “We need to think outside the model.” ' +
        'Shah’s team is one of the few healthcare research groups evaluating whether hospitals have the capacity to intervene based on a model, and whether on balance the interventions will be beneficial to patients and healthcare institutions. ' +
        "“There’s increasing concern that AI researchers are building models left and right and nothing's getting deployed,” Shah says. One reason for that is modelers’ failure to perform a usefulness analysis showing how the intervention triggered by a model will fit into hospital operations in a cost-effective way while also doing less harm than good. " +
        '“If model developers would spend the time to perform this additional analysis, hospitals will pay attention,” he says. ' +
        'The tools for doing a usefulness analysis already exist in the fields of operations research, healthcare policy, and econometrics, yet model developers in healthcare have been slow to use them, Shah says. His own team has tried to shift that mindset by publishing a handful of papers urging more people to evaluate their models’ usefulness. These include a JAMA paper setting forth the need for modelers to think about usefulness, and a research paper that lays out a framework for analyzing the usefulness of predictive models in healthcare and demonstrates how it would work using a real-world example. ' +
        '“Like any new thing that a hospital might add to its operations, deploying a new model must be worthwhile,” Shah says. “There are mature frameworks for determining a model’s worth. It’s time for modelers to use them.”',

        'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using Content here, content here, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for lorem ipsum will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.',
