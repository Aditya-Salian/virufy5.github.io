        'In the big scheme of healthcare operations, predictive models play a role not unlike that of blood tests, X-rays, or MRIs: They influence decisions about whether an intervention is appropriate. ' +
        '“Broadly speaking, models do math and yield probability estimates that help you decide whether to act,” says Nigam Shah, Chief Data Scientist for Stanford Health Care and a Stanford HAI faculty member. ' +
        'But those probability estimates are only useful to healthcare providers if they trigger decisions that are more beneficial than not. ' +
        '“As a community, I think we’re hung up on the performance of the model and not asking the question, Is the model useful?” Shah says. “We need to think outside the model.” ' +
        'Shah’s team is one of the few healthcare research groups evaluating whether hospitals have the capacity to intervene based on a model, and whether on balance the interventions will be beneficial to patients and healthcare institutions. ' +
        "“There’s increasing concern that AI researchers are building models left and right and nothing's getting deployed,” Shah says. One reason for that is modelers’ failure to perform a usefulness analysis showing how the intervention triggered by a model will fit into hospital operations in a cost-effective way while also doing less harm than good. " +
        '“If model developers would spend the time to perform this additional analysis, hospitals will pay attention,” he says. ' +
        'The tools for doing a usefulness analysis already exist in the fields of operations research, healthcare policy, and econometrics, yet model developers in healthcare have been slow to use them, Shah says. His own team has tried to shift that mindset by publishing a handful of papers urging more people to evaluate their models’ usefulness. These include a JAMA paper setting forth the need for modelers to think about usefulness, and a research paper that lays out a framework for analyzing the usefulness of predictive models in healthcare and demonstrates how it would work using a real-world example. ' +
        '“Like any new thing that a hospital might add to its operations, deploying a new model must be worthwhile,” Shah says. “There are mature frameworks for determining a model’s worth. It’s time for modelers to use them.”',
